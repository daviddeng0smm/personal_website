				<h1>My Journey</h1>
				<p>As a first-generation immigrant and a dedicated student at the University of California, Irvine,
					where I am currently pursuing a degree in software engineering, my journey has been marked by
					determination, innovation, and a relentless pursuit of excellence.</br>

					</br> Before embarking on my academic journey at UC Irvine, I was an entrepreneur, founding and
					managing several successful brands on Amazon. One of these ventures, "Home Penguin," specializes in
					high-quality construction tools such as contour gauges and hex wrenches, designed to meet the needs
					of both professionals and DIY enthusiasts. Another brand, "T-Nature," focuses on outdoor waterproof
					blankets, catering to nature lovers and outdoor enthusiasts.</br>

					</br> My entrepreneurial spirit also led me to manage an Airbnb property, where I took on the roles
					of both a designer and a coordinator. I personally oversaw the renovation, ensuring every detail was
					meticulously planned and executed, and organized professional photo shoots to highlight the unique
					features of the property.</br>

					</br> Since deciding to pursue a degree in technology, I have had the honor of being named an Apple
					Pathway Scholar, which has provided me with invaluable resources and mentorship. Additionally, I
					landed an internship at MetLife, gaining practical experience in the industry. Currently, I am a
					Software Engineer Fellow at HeadStarter, where I continue to hone my skills and contribute to
					innovative projects.</br>

					</br> Now, as I immerse myself in the world of software engineering, I am eager to gain more
					hands-on experience in the tech industry. My goal is to combine my entrepreneurial background with
					my technical skills to eventually launch my own startup, where I can bring innovative solutions to
					life and make a lasting impact in the tech world.</br>

					</br> This blend of academic rigor, entrepreneurial experience, and a forward-looking vision defines
					my professional journey, and I am excited to continue this path, embracing new challenges and
					opportunities along the way.</p>
